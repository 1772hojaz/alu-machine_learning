Bayesian probability is an interpretation of probability as a measure of belief or certainty rather than frequency. It is based on Bayes' Theorem, which describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence or information becomes available.



Bayes' Theorem: This is the mathematical rule that relates the prior, likelihood, and posterior. The formula is:

𝑃
(
𝐻
∣
𝐸
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐸
∣
𝐻
)
⋅
𝑃
(
𝐻
)
𝑃
(
𝐸
)
P(H∣E)= 
P(E)
P(E∣H)⋅P(H)
​
 
Where:

𝑃
(
𝐻
∣
𝐸
)
P(H∣E) is the posterior probability (probability of hypothesis 
𝐻
H given the evidence 
𝐸
E),
𝑃
(
𝐻
)
P(H) is the prior probability (initial probability of 
𝐻
H),
𝑃
(
𝐸
∣
𝐻
)
P(E∣H) is the likelihood (probability of evidence given 
𝐻
H),
𝑃
(
𝐸
)
P(E) is the marginal likelihood or evidence (total probability of the evidence).
