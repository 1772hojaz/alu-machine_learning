Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where algorithms analyze unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns, structures, or relationships without any prior guidance or labeled examples. Instead of predicting specific outcomes, it focuses on exploring the data and finding natural groupings or anomalies. 
What is unsupervised learning? (With examples)
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Unlabeled Data:
The core characteristic of unsupervised learning is that it works with data that doesn't have predefined categories or labels. 
Pattern Discovery:
The algorithms aim to identify patterns, structures, or groupings within the data without explicit instructions. 
Examples:
Some common unsupervised learning tasks include:
Clustering: Grouping similar data points together, like customer segmentation or anomaly detection. 
Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of variables while preserving important information, like in feature selection. 
Association Rule Learning: Discovering relationships between items, like "customers who bought X also bought Y". 
Contrast with Supervised Learning:
Unlike supervised learning, which uses labeled data to train models to predict specific outcomes, unsupervised learning explores the data to find inherent structures. 
Applications:
Unsupervised learning is valuable for tasks like:
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the underlying structure of data. 
Feature Extraction: Identifying key features for other machine learning tasks. 
Fraud Detection: Identifying unusual patterns that might indicate fraudulent activity. 
Personalization: Recommending products or content based on user behavior. 
Data Compression: Reducing the size of data while preserving important information.
